SecureWork Demo Video Script (~4:30)
1. Introduction & Founding Vision (25 s)
👋 “Hi, I’m Kelly Coldren, founder of SecureWork.”

“I saw a major issue in Web3 freelancing, mainly a lack of clarity on what is a real job, what is a scam and how to secure payment and to ensure job scope, and terms are documented and agreed upon by both parties from the onset.”

“So I built SecureWork to address these issues using ipfs to document scope and agreed terms, smart contracts to secure the funds in escrow, and to ensure steps are taken in the work flow process as to the terms documented in IPFS and then use AI to review work submissions to provide some automation to the process.”
