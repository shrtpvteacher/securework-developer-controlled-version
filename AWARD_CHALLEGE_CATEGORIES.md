## Best Use of AI

Secure Work uses AI at the core of the product: all submitted work is reviewed and evaluated by GPT-4, which compares deliverables against the contract’s original requirements stored on-chain. This ensures an unbiased, scalable, and transparent decision process for approving or rejecting work and automating fair payment release. AI is not an add-on, but an integral, trusted part of the workflow.

Every stage—from contract creation to file upload, AI review, and payout—is intuitive and visually clear. Responsive design and modern UI patterns make the experience smooth on both desktop and mobile, lowering friction for all users.
