## ‚ú® Project Overview

SecureWorkEscrow enables clients to post jobs, fund them with ETH, and approve freelancer submissions through on-chain AI or client verification. Freelancers accept jobs, submit work via IPFS, and receive payouts, with protections against inactivity or disputes. The system uses non-transferable NFT role tokens to enforce client-freelancer separation and includes safety mechanisms to prevent double funding, reentrancy attacks, and unauthorized access. Enhanced with **ReSend**, **DropBox**, **Pinata**, and **ChatGPT APIs**, it offers email notifications, file storage, IPFS pinning, and AI-driven verification support, making it a robust, production-ready solution.

### Key Features
- **One-Time Funding**: Jobs are funded once via `JobEscrow`, with immutable funding behavior.
- **NFT Role Tokens**: Non-transferable NFTs (`clientTokenId=0`, `freelancerTokenId=1`) ensure secure role-based access.
- **AI Verification**: An AI verifier (EOA) validates submissions, with client override for rejections.
- **Fallback Payout**: Client can refund funds if no action is taken (e.g., AI/freelancer inactivity).
- **Factory Deployment**: `JobEscrowFactory` deploys jobs with a 0.001 ETH creation fee.
- **API Integrations**:
  - **ReSend API**: Sends email notifications for job creation, funding, and verification.
  - **DropBox API**: Stores job submissions and metadata files.
  - **Pinata API**: Pins job metadata and submissions to IPFS for decentralized storage.
  - **ChatGPT API**: Enhances AI verification with natural language processing for submission analysis.
- **Frontend Integration**: Bolt-generated UI with live Ethereum and API interactions via Netlify Functions.
- **Security Mechanisms**: Reentrancy protection, double-funding guards, and immutable contract logic.

## üöÄ How Bolt Was Used

The core of SecureWorkEscrow was generated using **Bolt‚Äôs AI** via a **500-word prompt** designed to create a secure, decentralized escrow system. The prompt specified:
- NFT-based roles for clients and freelancers.
- AI-driven work verification with client override.
- A factory contract for job creation with platform fees.
- Netlify deployment with serverless functions for contract interactions.

Bolt‚Äôs AI produced:
- **`JobEscrow.sol`**: Manages the job lifecycle (funding, freelancer assignment, submission, verification, payout/refunded).
- **`JobEscrowFactory.sol`**: Deploys `JobEscrow` instances and collects a 0.001 ETH fee.
- **Frontend UI**: A Bolt-generated dashboard for job management.
- **Mock Netlify Functions**: Simulated contract interactions in `netlify/functions`.

The AI-generated code constitutes **90% of the project**, demonstrating Bolt‚Äôs ability to deliver functional, secure smart contracts and a deployable web app from a single prompt. All architecture and frontend logic remain Bolt-compliant, with targeted enhancements for production use.

## üîß Modifications and Enhancements

To make SecureWorkEscrow production-ready and suitable for a live demo, I made minimal, targeted edits to Bolt‚Äôs AI-generated code, independently and without external funding. These changes enhance security, enable live Ethereum and API interactions, and ensure robust deployment, while preserving Bolt‚Äôs core design.

### 1. Smart Contract Security Enhancements
- **Why**: Bolt‚Äôs `JobEscrow` used `.transfer`, limiting compatibility with smart contracts (e.g., multisigs) as clients/freelancers. The factory‚Äôs fee transfer lacked reentrancy protection, and state accounting could be improved.
- **Edits**:
  - **JobEscrow.sol**:
    - Replaced `.transfer` with `.call` in `_finalizeJob` and `refundToClient` for smart contract compatibility.
    - Added OpenZeppelin‚Äôs `ReentrancyGuard` with `nonReentrant` modifier to prevent reentrancy attacks.
    - Zeroed `amount` before payouts for clear accounting.
  - **JobEscrowFactory.sol**:
    - Added `ReentrancyGuard` to `createJobEscrow` to secure fee transfers to `contractFeeCollector`.
    - Enabled refund of excess `msg.value` for user-friendliness (e.g., if user sends >0.001 ETH).
    - Added validation to prevent job ID overwrites.
- **Impact**: Ensures robust security and flexibility, tested with Slither (`slither JobEscrow.sol`) and Foundry for reentrancy-proof design.

### 2. Netlify Functions: Mock to Live APIs
- **Why**: Bolt‚Äôs mock Netlify Functions simulated contract interactions, unsuitable for a live Sepolia demo.
- **Edits**:
  - Replaced mocks with live integrations using `ethers.js` and Alchemy‚Äôs Ethereum provider to interact with `JobEscrow` (e.g., `getJobInfo`, `fundEscrow`).
  - Integrated external APIs for enhanced functionality:
    - **ReSend API**: Sends email notifications for job events (creation, funding, verification).
    - **DropBox API**: Stores job submissions and metadata files, linked via `dropboxFinalSubmission`.
    - **Pinata API**: Pins job metadata and submissions to IPFS, ensuring decentralized storage.
    - **ChatGPT API**: Supports AI verification by analyzing submission content (e.g., text-based work).
  - Updated frontend components (e.g., `src/components/JobManager.js`) to call live functions.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `netlify/functions/callContract.js`
  - `netlify/functions/fundEscrow.js`
  - `netlify/functions/notify.js` (ReSend integration)
  - `netlify/functions/uploadToDropBox.js` (DropBox integration)
  - `netlify/functions/pinToIPFS.js` (Pinata integration)
  - `netlify/functions/analyzeSubmission.js` (ChatGPT integration)
  - `src/components/JobManager.js`
- **Impact**: Enables real-time Ethereum and API interactions, showcasing a dynamic, user-friendly app.

### 3. Netlify Environment Variables and Secrets
- **Why**: Live APIs and Ethereum provider require secure configuration to avoid hardcoded sensitive data.
- **Edits**:
  - Added environment variables in Netlify UI:
    - `ALCHEMY_API_KEY`: Connects to Sepolia via Alchemy.
    - `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: Deployed `JobEscrowFactory` address.
    - `RESEND_API_KEY`: Authenticates ReSend API for email notifications.
    - `DROPBOX_API_KEY`: Authenticates DropBox API for file storage.
    - `PINATA_API_KEY`: Authenticates Pinata API for IPFS pinning.
    - `CHATGPT_API_KEY`: Authenticates ChatGPT API for submission analysis.
  - Updated `netlify.toml` to specify `functions = "netlify/functions"`.
- **Impact**: Ensures secure, scalable deployment compliant with best practices.

### 4. Testing and Auditing
- **Why**: To validate security, API integrations, and functionality for production and hackathon evaluation.
- **Edits**:
  - Ran Slither (`slither JobEscrow.sol`, `slither JobEscrowFactory.sol`) to detect vulnerabilities; addressed all warnings.
  - Used Foundry to test reentrancy with a malicious freelancer contract; all attacks failed.
  - Tested API integrations:
    - ReSend: Verified email delivery for job events.
    - DropBox: Confirmed file uploads and retrieval.
    - Pinata: Validated IPFS pinning for metadata and submissions.
    - ChatGPT: Ensured accurate submission analysis.
  - Deployed to Sepolia for live testing of job workflows.
- **Impact**: Demonstrates a secure, audited, and fully functional project, boosting technical execution scores.

### Why These Edits?
The modifications were essential to:
- **Enhance Security**: Protect against reentrancy and support smart contract clients/freelancers.
- **Enable Live Functionality**: Replace mocks with Ethereum and external API interactions (ReSend, DropBox, Pinata, ChatGPT) for a working demo.
- **Ensure Production-Readiness**: Configure secure deployment with Netlify secrets.
These changes enhance Bolt‚Äôs AI-generated code without altering its core architecture, maintaining full compliance with the hackathon‚Äôs ecosystem.

## ‚úç How It Works
1. **Job Creation**: Client deploys a `JobEscrow` contract via `JobEscrowFactory`, paying a 0.001 ETH fee (sent to `contractFeeCollector`). ReSend API notifies client/freelancer.
2. **Funding**: Client funds the job via `fundEscrow`, locking ETH. ReSend confirms funding.
3. **Freelancer Assignment**: Client assigns a freelancer, who accepts, receiving an NFT (`freelancerTokenId=1`).
4. **Submission**: Freelancer uploads work to DropBox, pins metadata/submission link to IPFS via Pinata, and submits via `submitForFinal`.
5. **Verification**:
   - AI verifier (augmented by ChatGPT API) approves via `verifyByAI`, releasing funds; ReSend notifies parties.
   - If rejected, freelancer requests client verification (`requestClientVerification`).
   - Client overrides via `verifyByClient`, releasing funds or refunding via `refundToClient`.
6. **Metadata**: Job details (description, submission links) are stored on IPFS via Pinata, referenced in `metadataURI`.
