# Freelance Job Escrow System

### Built for the 2025 Bolt Hackathon ‚Äì World's Largest Hackathon by Dev Con

This project is a decentralized freelance escrow system built using smart contracts generated by [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new) and enhanced for real-world robustness. It allows clients to post jobs, fund them, and approve freelancer submissions through on-chain verification. The system includes safety mechanisms to prevent double funding, enforce proper role separation, and handle edge cases like AI rejection or inactivity.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* ‚úÖ One-time funding logic with reentrancy protection
* ‚úÖ NFT role tokens for client and freelancer
* ‚úÖ AI verifier logic for work approval
* ‚úÖ Client override if AI rejects work
* ‚úÖ Freelancer fallback payout if no action is taken after 30 days
* ‚úÖ Frontend-safe data structure for job status and metadata

## ‚ö† Security Enhancements

We did **not receive any funding** to implement the following improvements. They were made independently to enhance the security of the Bolt-generated smart contracts:

* Added `require` guards against **reentrancy and double funding**.
* Prevented abuse of fallback/receive logic.
* Implemented **fallback mechanisms** for clients and freelancers in cases of AI rejection or silence.
* Ensured **immutable funding behavior** post-deployment.

These changes were implemented in the smart contract logic only. All architecture and frontend logic remain Bolt-compliant.

## ‚öñ Roles

* **Client (owner)**: Funds the job and has override power after AI rejection.
* **Freelancer**: Submits work and can trigger a payout if client or AI is inactive.
* **AI Verifier**: An oracle or manual agent to confirm whether submitted work is valid.

## ‚õè Technologies Used

* Solidity (v0.8.19)
* OpenZeppelin Contracts (Ownable, ERC721)
* Bolt.new contract generation
* IPFS for job metadata
* Frontend logic (Bolt dashboard + custom wallet flow)

## ‚úç How It Works

1. Client creates a job via the factory and pays a creation fee.
2. Metadata includes IPFS hash with job description and ETH amount required.
3. Contract is deployed and only fundable once.
4. Freelancer accepts and submits work.
5. AI verifier reviews the work.

   * If approved, funds are released.
   * If rejected, client can override.
   * If no action for 30 days, freelancer can claim payout.

## ‚ú® Credit

* Contracts generated using [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new)
* Enhanced by the Freelance Payables team to reflect real-world edge cases and security needs.
* All work conforms to the rules and structure of the 2025 Bolt Hackathon.

## üåü Project Goals

To demonstrate how Bolt-generated contracts can be responsibly modified to increase robustness while staying compliant with the hackathon ecosystem. We aim to ship a usable freelance escrow system that reflects the realities of smart contract usage in production.
