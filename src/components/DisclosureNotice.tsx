            <p>
              This platform is designed to increase trust between clients and freelancers by holding project funds in escrow and storing job terms permanently on IPFS. When a job is created, both parties agree to clear deliverables, deadlines, and compensation ‚Äî and the client demonstrates commitment by funding the job upfront.

                SecureWork does <strong>not</strong> replace the need for human interaction. Clients and freelancers are expected to communicate, collaborate, and clarify expectations throughout the process. Verification steps (by AI or by the client) help reinforce quality, but final judgment and mutual understanding still rest with the participants.

                In the event of a serious dispute, SecureWork provides verifiable evidence ‚Äî including timestamps, agreements, and submission records ‚Äî but does not serve as an arbitrator or legal authority. Parties may still seek resolution through other means, with the benefit of immutable proof of their agreement.
